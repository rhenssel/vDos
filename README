README for vDos

vDos is derived from DOSBox (http://sourceforge.net/projects/dosbox/).

Where DOSBox is targeted at gaming and available for several operating
systems. vDos is for serious (text mode) DOS applications, Windows 32/64 bits
(XP and later) only. It lacks many of the hardware emulations of DOSBox (for
instance graphics is only basic VGA). Instead it adds a live file system, file
and record locking, (Windows) printing, a scalable font and more. You should be
able to run your DOS application quickly in a safe and convenient way.

If you consider using DOSBox with a database application DONT! most likely you
will end up with corrupted databases.
