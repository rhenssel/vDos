Rem Keyboard (docu)
rem ===============
rem [Alt][Enter] switches to and from full screen mode.
rem [Win]+F11 decreases, [Win]+F12 increases the point size of the font and so the window size.
rem The point size of the built-in font is always even to assure an optimal alignment of line drawing characters.
rem [Win][Ctrl]+C copies the DOS screen to a file that is opened by the Windows program assigned to text files.
rem [Win][Ctrl]+V pastes the Windows clipboard to the DOS keyboard.


Rem Select and copy text (docu)
rem ===========================
rem Start selecting a rectangle block of text with [Win][Ctrl]+mouse click.
rem Drag the mouse and release the mouse button, the selected text is in the Window clipboard.


Rem Options
rem =======
Rem vDos supports some options, you set them in this file.
rem The default settings should only be changed if needed.
rem Don't try to include DOS config.sys settings like KEYB=, that won't work!


Rem Memory
rem ======
rem The first 64 KB (low) memory block is excluded.
rem If you need more than 575KB of conventional memory:
rem LOW = ON

rem Upper memory blocks are also not available.
rem You can get an extra 127KB with: 
rem UMB = ON

rem Extended memory is always 16MB, that should be sufficient for any DOS program.

EMS = ON

Rem Mouse
rem =====
rem In text mode the mouse is disabled.
rem Many DOS programs just manage the mouse badly.
rem MOUSE = ON


Rem Window/font
rem ===========
rem Text is displayed using a built-in TTF font.
rem If you want to use another TTF font, copy that file to the vDos directory.
rem FONT = CONSOLA

rem The vDos window has no borders or title bar.
rem Hover over the top line, a minimize button will appear in the upper right corner.
rem Left click and drag the window to move it.
rem No close button, you have to use Exit to close the window.
rem If you’re willing to sacrifice some screen space to get borders and title bar:
FRAME = ON

rem The initial window will cover max 75% of the screen.
rem To change this, use WINDOW = <max percentage>:
rem This would give you a full screen window:
WINDOW = 50

rem The number of lines/columns in text mode are the familiar 25/80.
rem You can override this by LINS = <24..60> and COLS = <80..160>. 
rem And use any combination of these.
rem See for yourself if this is useful or even supported by your application.

rem You can postpone vDos from displaying anything.
rem Default = 0.5 seconds, so in most cases the initial black DOS screen won't show up.
rem This value is in tenths of a seconds, to hide the vDos window for 1 second:
rem HIDE = 10

rem To use a different color scheme in text mode, supply 16 color values in RGB(r,g,b) or hexadecimal as in HTML: #RRBBGG.
rem This gives you a bit dimmed color scheme (first line is docu):
rem				0 - Black	1 - Blue	2 - Green 	3 - Aqua 	4 - Red 	5 - Purple	6 - Yellow 	7 - White 		8 - Gray	9 - Lt Blue		10 - Lt Green	11 - Lt Aqua	12 - Lt Red		13- Lt Purple	14 - Lt Yellow	15 - Bright White
COLORS =	(16,16,16)	#1040B1		(0,152,0)	(0,144,176)	(176,32,64)	(144,0,176)	(208,96,0)	(192,192,192)	(96,96,96)	(40,136,255)	(120,184,0)		(144,244,224)	(216,72,48)		(224,244,255)	(244,224,128)	(240,240,240)

rem To scale the window in DOS graphics mode:
rem SCALE = <1..9> (that’s 100..900%).
rem It won't be that nice, 1 point is simply enlarged to 2x2 points:
rem SCALE = 2


rem Printing
rem ========
rem LPT<1..9> and COM<1..9> are available for printing, creating RTF (Word), PDF documents or mailing.
rem The shareware program DOSPrinter handles printer output, note it only supports ESC/P (the most widely used DOS printer).
rem If nothing is set, it will pop up a printer selection dialog when an application prints to a port.
rem Some examples, have a look at the DOSPrinter.pdf for more options:
rem LPT1 = /SEL2 /CPIA /LEFT0.50 /TOP0.50
rem COM1 = /SEL /SEL2 /RTF /CPIA /LEFT0.75 /TOP0.75 /65
rem If you have a printer that supports your DOS application output directly:
rem LPT2 = /SEL'HPLaserJet2200' /RAW

rem Just ignore the output:
rem LPT3 = DUMMY

rem Start a Windows application with the printer data:
rem COM2 = notepad #com2.txt

rem If your DOS application supports PCL or PostScript printers.
rem You’re lucky: great printouts and nothing to set!
rem Output to these printers is automatically detected, converted to PDF and shown in the default PDF reader.
rem The program (ps)pcl6.exe is required in the vDos directory.
rem You can download these at http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/ghostpcl.html (GhostPCL-W32-Binaries.zip).
